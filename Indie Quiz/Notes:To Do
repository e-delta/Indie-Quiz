- Need to more efficiently write -genRandQuote. It is going to get too cumbersome to use switch
    :::Done, thank to Nick.

- Need a way to cross check the list of quotes for repeats once it gets large

- I want to start a master file for all the quotes and read them into the program, either into an array which will randomize
    them, or randomly choosen from the file. 
    
- Need to spice up the user interface with some cool graphics to make it look nice

- I want to have a WinStudios launch image with a sound effect
 
- Need to make the text wrap so the whole quote can be read... maybe use a scroll view as an embedded subview of the window??
    :::I solved this issue for now using the numberOfLines property of UILabel but this is not a
    :::permanent solution becasue some quotes may be really long.
